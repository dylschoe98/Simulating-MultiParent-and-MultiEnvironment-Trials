# Simulating-MultiParent-and-MultiEnvironment-Trials

This repository presents a series of functions that allows users to generate simulated gamete and progenies from biparental and multi-parental populations. Simulated phenotypes are derived based on a user provided genetic model. Simulated multi-environment trials can be created where within-environment errors can vary by a given probability.
