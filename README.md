# Simulating-MultiParent-and-MultiEnvironment-Trials

This repository presents a series of functions that allows for the generation of simulated gamete and progenies from biparental and multi-parental populations. Gametes are simulated based on a user-provided frequency and can be based on simulated or emperical genetic data. The simulated genotypes are derived based on a user provided genetic model. 

The functions allow for the simualtion of multi-environment trials (METs). Individuals are randomly assigned to environments of interest either in a balanced or within a sparse-testing strategy. For METs, users can obtain within-environment errors that vary based on a given probability. The METs can be designed using partially replicated or balanced experimental designs.
